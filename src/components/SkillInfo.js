				About Me
I have over 10 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient front-end developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services. I love creating things and researching new ideas and technologies. While software engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
